# Creating Smart Contracts

So you want to upload a smart contract to immortalize some computational logic? Faaar out dude.

Creating a software program is great. It lets others interact with whatever your imagination can conceive. So let's begin and create a simple smart contract to understand the fundamentals.

## Before We Start

If you are new and unsure about your ability of creating smart contracts from scratch then you can check out some of the production ready contracts from the guys at [cosmwasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-plus)

## Learning The Syntax

CosmWasm uses the Rust language, which you will use to write your contract. Eventually when you are finished you will run specific software that will compile down this code into a binary file. This file can then be uploaded to the Juno blockchain.

If you wish to learn the Rust language you can follow this guide as a starting point: [Learn Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)ðŸ“˜

Eventually Golang will be also be supported for writing the contracts, and in the future when the EVM is ready, even Javascript.

## Forking The Sample Project

We went ahead and created a sample project that you can fork to follow along with. This repo contains the files that are needed to proceed to the next step.
