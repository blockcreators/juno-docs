# Compiling Smart Contracts

## Compiling The Code

Once you have your contract ready, you need to compile it so that it can be uploaded. So go into the folder where the contract exists on your terminal and run:

```text
code to compile
```

Once that is done you should see the newly generated file within the folder that ends with **.wasm**
