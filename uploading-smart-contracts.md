# Uploading Smart Contracts

So you want to upload a smart contract to immortalize some computational logic?

Faaar out dude. That sounds _rad_.

First thing you need to do is either write a smart contract \(in Rust\) or to use/edit one of the production ready contracts from the guys at [cosmwasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-plus)

Once you have your contract ready, you need to compile it so that it can be uploaded. So go into the folder where the contract exists on your terminal and run:

```text
code here to compile
```

Once that is done you should see the newly generated file within the folder that ends with **.wasm**

Now you can upload it to the chain with the following command:

```text
code to upload
```
