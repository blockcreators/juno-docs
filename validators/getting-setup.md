# Getting Setup

Welcome To The _Wild West_

So you want to get your hands dirty and become a validator?

The best way for you to learn the tools of the trade, is to start with one of Junos testnets. Here you will most likely run into issues and learn how to overcome them so that you can prepare yourself for real world dangers and bugs. Now is the time to battle harden your validator!

{% hint style="info" %}
Testnets come and go, so to find out which is the latest, please go to our discord validator-lounge channel: [Discord-Validator-Lounge](https://discord.gg/QcWPfK4gJ2%20)

Feel ready to get started?, let's get moving and install starport:

> Starport is the easiest way to build a blockchain. It is a developer-friendly interface to the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), the world's most widely-used blockchain application framework. Starport generates boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing business logic.

**Prerequisites:** If you want to install Starport locally, make sure to have [Golang &gt;=1.16](https://golang.org/). The latest version of Starport also requires [Protocol Buffer compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) to be installed. [Node.js &gt;=12.19.0](https://nodejs.org/) is used to build the welcome screen, block explorer and to run the web scaffold.

{% hint style="info" %}
Starport uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). **Please make sure that it is installed before cloning Starport.** If you have installed Git LFS after cloning Starport, checkout to your preferred branch to trigger a pull for large files or run **`git lfs pull`**
{% endhint %}

You need to ensure your gopath configuration is correct. If the following **'make'** step does not work then you might have to add these lines to your .profile or .zshrc in the users home folder:

```bash
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GO111MODULE=on
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin
```

> Now lets build and install `starport` binary into `$GOBIN`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tendermint/starport
cd starport && git checkout develop
make
```

**Note**: When building from source, it is important to have your `$GOPATH` set correctly. When in doubt, the following should do:

```bash
mkdir ~/go
export GOPATH=~/go
```
