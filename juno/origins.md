# Origins

**Juno**  is a sovereign blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to provide a turnkey environment for the deployment of smart contracts. The Cosmos Contracts network serves as a decentralized, permission-less & censorship resistant avenue for developers & projects to efficiently and securely launch application specific smart contracts using proven frameworks such as CosmWasm.

The chain is built using the highly scalable starport framework and agreement on the network is reached in a decentralized way via Tendermint BFT consensus. An independent set of validators & delegators secure the mainnet via delegated proof of stake. 

$Juno, the native asset of the network, serves as a work token to give access to on chain governance, security of the blockchain and to provide utility in the deployment and execution of smart contracts.
